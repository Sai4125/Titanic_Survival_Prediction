# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses Machine Learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on features like age, sex, class, etc.

## 📚 Project Overview

Using a dataset from the Titanic disaster, we aim to:
- Analyze passenger data
- Preprocess the data
- Apply machine learning models
- Predict the survival of passengers

The notebook `Project_15_Titanic_Survival_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning.ipynb` contains the complete workflow.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
